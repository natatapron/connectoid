
	This is a 100% functionally working light-weight *copy* of properJavaRDP code:
		http://properjavardp.sourceforge.net
	
	This code should remain working at all times and will be used as a back-up
	reference in case Connectoid breaks any basic RDP functionality.
	
	This code will be lightened up from the original properJavaRDP and whittled
	down to only the essential elements needed to run. This will help to identify
	the boundary between what code is common to both Android Platform and the
	Java AWT, and what code is needed only by the Java AWT.

    As a general rule:
      1) Only comment out things you want to remove
      2) Import in to Connectoid[.interim] and see if it works
      3) Delete something only if you are *100.0%* certain that it isn't needed  
	
	Things that have been or will be removed include:
		Native client detection
		Command line arguments [getopt] - This doesn't make sense in Android.
		SendEvent tool - This is optional and will be implemented differently in Android.
		The pop-down menu - This will be implemented differently in Android.
		Clipboard Copy/Paste anything other than text 
		log4j may be replaced w/ java.util.logging.
		Caching may be lightened up or removed entirely.
		Localized input may be lightened up or removed entirely; I will need to learn more
		  about how Android is localized. 

	
	Finally, this code is also here to cross-reference any potential changes in properJavaRDP in the future.
	I don't know anywhere near as much about RDP as the folks that wrote this.
	As such, I will probably not many *any* changes the the base RDP code.
	If I do find anything that needs to be changed I will integrate it to the official properJavaRDP source code.
